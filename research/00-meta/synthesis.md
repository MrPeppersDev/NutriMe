# NutriMe — Stage 2 Synthesis

> Living document capturing Stage 2 synthesis decisions. As tensions surfaced during research are resolved through dialogue, the resolutions are recorded here with pointers to which docs were updated. The full per-sweep findings remain in each sweep's `## Findings` section; this doc captures the cross-cutting decisions.

## How this doc works

Each resolved tension gets a section with: what surfaced during research, what we resolved it to, why (user direction), and which docs were updated. Roadmap tracks open tensions; this doc tracks resolved ones.

## Tension 1 — Mental-load framing supersedes raw-time, plus inventory tracking distinction

### What surfaced

- **Sweep #7** (cooking time + barriers): Bowen et al., reinforced by Wolfson 2016 + Lavelle 2016 — *cognitive overhead* of cooking, not time itself, is the primary barrier for busy adults. The constant deciding (what to make, what to buy, what's in the fridge, what fits, what the household will eat, how long it takes) is what exhausts people.
- **Sweep #13** (grocery infrastructure): "Pantry observed not asked" pattern proposed as a workaround to keep pantry awareness without violating the no-logging rule.

The two surfaced separately but resolve together because they share an underlying insight: removing the deciding/remembering/worrying is more important than removing minutes.

### Resolution

**1. Mental-load framing is co-equal with time-saving in product-framing.md**, not a replacement. Convenience messaging continues to lead with time ("boom, shows up at my door"); mental-load framing makes the deeper value prop explicit underneath.

**2. Convenience driver list expanded** to surface what mental-load research found:
- Removing planning effort
- Removing shopping effort
- Removing **deciding** (formerly "decision fatigue") — sharpened
- Removing **remembering** (what's in the fridge, what's been tried, what household members liked) — new
- Removing **monitoring / worrying** (am I covering nutrition, varying enough, within budget) — new
- Removing skill-acquisition burden

**3. Time stays central as a surface frame.** Recipe time estimates and per-meal time-accuracy feedback are kept — accurate time *reduces* mental load (one less thing to compute). The mental-load framing reinforces, not replaces, the time-accuracy work.

**4. Horizon-broadening pacing is NOT affected by mental-load research.** Per user direction: introduce variety at the iterative pace already established.

**5. Inventory tracking is a distinct data layer, in scope, and explicitly distinguished from food/macro/calorie logging.**

- *Logging (out per Rule 3)*: tracking what you ate; computing calories/macros consumed
- *Inventory (in)*: knowing what's on hand in pantry/fridge/freezer so the system uses what you have, avoids reordering, and minimizes waste

**Inventory mechanics:**
- Initial intake at onboarding (general inventory, loose — what staples + perishables you keep)
- Ongoing maintenance via orders + cook confirmations (passive observation)
- Just-in-time clarification when building a specific recipe / shopping list ("how much rice do you have?")
- Loose quantities by default — exact amounts only asked when they matter for a specific output

**Use-existing-ingredients priority:** meal planning prefers recipes that consume what's on hand; shopping list aware of what's there; waste-reduction is an implicit goal.

This **resolves Tension #3 (pantry "observed not asked") preemptively.** Sweep #13's "observed only" pattern was a workaround to avoid violating Rule 3; with the inventory/logging distinction now clear, *both observed and asked* are fine, with quantities loose unless precision is needed.

### Why (user direction)

User direction (2026-04-29, Stage 2 dialogue):
> "I don't think, though, that it has anything to do with the introduction of new things to avoid overwhelming. What I do want to put an emphasis on, though, is making sure we are using what exists and we have some intake process for what exists in a person's pantry, fridge, freezer, etc. The place I do think this doubles with possibly other apps is in necessarily tracking macros, but it is inventory tracking. Like, what do we have on hand to use in these things? We don't necessarily always need to know how much of something we have on hand. That's something we can always reach out and ask the user for clarification when building a recipe list and a shopping list. We should prioritize using existing ingredients and using those up as well."

### Updates applied

- **product-framing.md** — convenience driver list expanded (deciding/remembering/monitoring); mental-load co-equal frame added; inventory tracking added as a value prop with explicit "uses what you have" framing
- **intake-pattern.md** — new "Inventory awareness — a parallel data layer" section
- **constitutional-rules.md** — Rule 3 (no logging) clarified to specify inventory tracking is *not* food/macro/calorie logging and IS in scope
- **sweep #11 (recipe sourcing)** — recipe selection priority list now includes "uses-existing-ingredients" factor
- **sweep #13 (grocery infrastructure)** — pantry section updated: explicit inventory intake + just-in-time clarification supplement the observed-from-orders pattern
- **roadmap.md** — Tension #1 and Tension #3 both marked resolved in synthesis-phase tensions section

*Future tensions will be added as resolved.*
